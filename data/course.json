By the end of the course, you should be able to design controllers using state-space methods and evaluate whether these controllers are robust to some types of modeling errors and nonlinearities. You will learn to:\n\n*   Design controllers using state-space methods and analyze using classical tools.\n*   Understand impact of implementation issues (nonlinearity, delay).\n*   Indicate the robustness of your control design.\n*   Linearize a nonlinear system, and analyze stability.\n",
